This is a repository for some old android games I developed around 2013-2014. Unlikely to use again. Unfortunately, it seems I lost the source for all my published android games, only keeping windows versions.

The real interesting parts are the two fractile generation programs which I have the source for.

1: TheParticles. Original version, very crude, lots of noisy stuff. Not great. Still, has the city fractal I like and haven't figured out how to make again.

2. GeneralLinearRecurance. After "losing" The particles, I recreated the program over a weekend with hind sight and significantly better coding skills. If I ever want to use again, I should extend this version. Still, I notice some unexpected qualitative differences between the fractals these two produce. While the mesh generation is much better on the new fractal, the old one produced more interesting fractals somehow. If I ever feel like messing with this kind of fractal again, I would like to figure out this discrepency.
